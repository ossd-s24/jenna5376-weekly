title: Week 10 - Failed Attempt at Contributing to an Issue
---

### Our Big Realization
This week, I wanted to make my first pull request. I started off by doing some freeCodeCamp challenges and looking through the project repository to familiarize myself with the project. I thought that it would be easy to contribute to freeCodeCamp because there were so many (over 250) open issues. Unfortunately, I found out that just because an issue was open didn't mean that it was open for contribution. When I looked through past open and closed issues to understand how contributing worked on freeCodeCamp, I realized that the only issues you can actually contribute to are those labeled with "help wanted" or "first timers only" labels. One of my group members, Ben, also ran into this same issue as he spent days working on a pull request, just to have it blocked with this comment: "Only issues with the help wanted or first timers only label are open for contributing." This was the moment we realized that contributing to freeCodeCamp was going to be harder than we thought.

### Failed Attempt at Contributing
Once I sorted the issues to find those with both the "scope: UI" label and a "helped wanted" or "first timers only" label, I couldn't find any open issues related to UI. I found another simple issue called "Change "a href" to "an href"". I researched online to find which variant was more commonly used and commented, ""An href" and "an HTML" seem more commonly used. I'm new to contributing so I would love to work on this issue!" I kept refreshing this thread to see if it was open for contribution as the issue had a "status: waiting triage" tag when I commented. Unfortunately, by the time the issue tag changed to "first timers only", another contributor made a pull request within hours, and the issue was closed. Some of our initial concerns with freeCodeCamp were coming to the surface, and I realized that if I wanted to contribute to this project, I was going to have to be more on top of tracking issues. Like Ben, I downloaded the GitHub app and set notifications for this repository.
