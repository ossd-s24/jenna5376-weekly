title: Week 3 - Git Exercises + Browser Extension
---

I found the git exercises really helpful because I typically rely on GitHub Desktop's GUI to perform git commands. I learned to fork a repository and pull remote changes for the first time, and I think using git on the command line would help me work faster and perform a more robust set of commands in the long run. We made a good amount of progress towards our browser extension. We chose to create an extension to block distracting websites. We finished implementing the design for all the screens for our extension and implemented a feature to block the current site you are on. As I have experience with UI design and front-end development, I worked on designing the extension's UI on Figma and creating layouts and styling using HTML and CSS. I also made the tab buttons on our extension functional by adding some JS. I think our group is quite balanced as I prefer front-end while my teammates prefer back-end, so we have a well-rounded set of skills. We have been using Instagram DMs to communicate. We have yet to face any challenges so far, but I think we could face some challenges making the project follow the best practices of open source, as that is something we have less experience with.
