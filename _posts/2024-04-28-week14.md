title: Week 14 - Applications of Open Source and Group Progress

### Applications of Open Source

I found our class discussion about different applications of open source concepts interesting as I was primarily aware of the software applications. Projects that stood out were FreeSewing as I love clothes, and Precious Plastic, which sounded like an awesome initiative that is a win-win for both people and the

environment. I also found it funny that there were open-source recipes for beers and colas and that some of these recipes apparently didn't taste great. Overall, the discussion made me realize that open-source concepts can truly be applied to anything.

### Group Progress

As mentioned in my previous blog post, my group wanted to work on creating pull requests for an issue Sam raised. Though Sam and I were able to make pull requests as planned, another freeCodeCamp contributor came in and made three pull requests all at once (!) and Ben couldn't contribute to this specific issue. I think this example really demonstrates the difficulty of working on contributions as a group for a project as large as freeCodeCamp. However, I am quite satisfied with how contributing to freeCodeCamp has been going. I got the pull request I made for the group issue merged and got a pretty big contribution I made for the profile section (creating a stats component) merged, so I feel proud of my progress.
