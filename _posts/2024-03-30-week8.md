title: Week 8 - Making Our First Contributions
---

### Plans and Setup
My group started making our first contributions to freeCodeCamp this week. I felt intimidated as it was my first time contributing to a large project. Because of this, as I discussed in my last week's blog post, my group decided to make simple contributions (fixing typos, responding to forum posts, etc.) this week.

We started off by setting up the development environment locally. Although I don't have a lot of experience making open-source contributions, I found this process easy because freeCodeCamp had a detailed step-by-step setup guide. We also looked at freeCodeCamp's guidelines for contributing UI and read the documentation for Tailwind, the CSS framework used by freeCodeCamp.

### Contributions and Challenges
After reading through some documentation, I started looking for easy issues I could contribute to. Unfortunately, although freeCodeCamp had a label for "first timers only" issues, there were no open issues with this tag. Because of this, I instead decided to contribute by commenting on the community forum. I responded to two forum posts: one asking for recommendations on what projects they can do to practice, and another asking for help on one of the freeCodeCamp challenges. Although I was able to comment and contribute to these forum discussions, I started understanding why past freeCodeCamp groups had issues contributing to the project. Even when I sorted the forum posts by most recently added, it was hard to find posts I could comment on as other community members would respond to posts in mere minutes.

### Next Steps
My group decided to up the challenge for next week by setting the goals of continuing to learn Tailwind and contributing to a UI component. We also set the goal of looking through freeCodeCamp's lesson plans to familiarize ourselves with them and think of ways we can create one of our own.
