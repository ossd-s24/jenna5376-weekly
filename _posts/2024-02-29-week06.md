title: Week 6 - Thoughts on Open Source Projects
---

### Thoughts on projects I looked at
I like many of the projects I looked at so far and feel excited about contributing to them. I was intimidated at first because the first project I analyzed closely was OpenEmu. This project is coded in Swift, C, and Objective-C--all languages I am not as comfortable with--and I had no idea how I could solve any of the technical issues that were reported.

However, I felt a lot more excited after analyzing freeCodeCamp and p5.js, which are projects I have used and considered contributing to for a while. Both projects are built using languages I am familiar with (JavaScript, TypeScript) and are resources that are aimed towards helping people learn how to code. FreeCodeCamp's mission is to help people learn to code, build projects, and earn certifications for free while p5's mission is to provide a creative coding library to make coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. I feel like these missions are reflected in not only the projects themselves but also the open-source community behind them. Both projects have a lot of clear documentation to help people of all levels contribute to the project. Additionally, I like that both projects seem to be backed by helpful, friendly, and encouraging communities. I think the main difference between the two is that freeCodeCamp is faster-paced, but I would be happy and able to learn a lot from contributing to either!

Another project that sounded interesting was Spicetify. I remember seeing a video of the project on Instagram but did not know that it was open source. I think it could be fun to contribute to this project as I enjoy design and front-end development. The project also reminded me that it is possible to contribute to a project through feature additions.

### What I am excited about
The thing I am most excited about regarding working on an open-source project is getting to work on a large project. Most of my past internships have been for UI/UX Design and the projects I worked on have been on the smaller side, so I feel like I could learn a lot about navigating larger projects, communicating effectively, and utilizing good coding practices through contributing to open source projects. 

Additionally, I am excited to make improvements to projects I care about. I have been using projects like freeCodeCamp, p5.js, and Visual Studio Code for a long time (p5.js is what originally led me to double major in CS), so I would love to give back to the community by improving them. Finally, I am excited about the opportunity to potentially get better at improving my JavaScript/TypeScript skills, especially since very few NYU CS classes allow me to utilize these languages.

### Potential challenges
I feel like there will be many challenges since I am still relatively new to open-source contributions. I think the biggest challenge would be knowing how to navigate a big project to find and address issues. As mentioned, I only have experience with smaller programming projects so I think it could be challenging to make improvements to a larger project--especially while following good coding conventions and possibly a coding style. I think it could also be difficult to implement improvements to the project efficiently as I am not sure how the bigger projects may leverage things like code reuse.

I think another challenge would be finding issues I can realistically work on. Although the projects I examined (p5.js, freeCodeCamp), support beginner contributors and have issues with "first timers only" labels, I noticed that a lot of these easier issues are resolved very quickly and that many of the open issues tend to be more technically challenging to address. I am going to try to overcome this challenge by actively looking at open issues to claim these "easier" issues as soon as they become available, at least for my first few contributions. Additionally, many large open-source projects have community chats, so I am planning on utilizing them to seek technical help when needed.
