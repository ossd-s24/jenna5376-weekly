title: Week 2 - Thoughts on Code of Conduct
---

Reading various Codes of Conduct made me realize that these guidelines can not only outline rules and regulations but also set a tone for a community. For instance, I liked how Go's Code of Conduct utilizes terms like "Gophers and "Gopher values" to unite contributors and communicate that Go has a friendly community.

Overall, I think Codes of Conduct could help encourage cooperation and kindness within a community. As open source projects may have contributors from all different backgrounds, I feel like these guidelines could set a baseline of what is appropriate behavior for the specific community. Though a project not having a Code of Conduct wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me, it would make me think that the project doesn't prioritize fostering a healthy, cooperative community. In these cases, I would look through past activities to understand what the community is like. 

Though Codes of Conduct can outline expectations for the community, I think enforcing rules is difficult--especially in larger projects--due to the nature of open-source projects. I also think the type of people who violate Codes of Conduct tend to be those who don't care about following these rules in the first place. However, I think Codes of Conduct could give community members the authority to tell others they are behaving inappropriately, which could encourage good behaviors through social enforcement.
